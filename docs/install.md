## Installation

Requirements:

- **NodeJS LTS (v12)** https://nodejs.org/en/ 
- **OpenJDK v11.** https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/ (search for 11.35.13-ca-jdk11.0.5)

Once dependencies are installed you can install the CLI and WEB packages:

```sh
npm install -g @relate/cli
npm install -g @relate/web
```

We strongly recommend that you install both packages.
