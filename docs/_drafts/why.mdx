# Gram - Graphs as paths

Gram is a path-based graph representation. 

Goals:

-  Be able to say something about paths
-  Be able to process graphs as a stream
-  Be friendly for humans to write and machines to read


## 1. See the Forest Paths

Nodes and edges are powerful for structuring information. Full graphs have interesting features. 

>  Graph theory was invented to <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_KÃ¶nigsberg">find a path</Link> 
>  yet dwells on the pieces of the puzzle rather than the resulting picture.

Until graphs became databases, Paths didn't really need to be concrete. Mathematical graphs are
  usually lightweight, maybe names on Nodes to give them identity and numbers on Edges to give them "weight".

Thinking about graphs as an information architecture, as used in 
  the <Link href="https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/">Property Graph Model</Link>, both Nodes and 
  Edges are much richer data records. Missing is being able to say something about entire Paths. 


### Path Information - Route 66
Head west from St.Louis in the USA and you may be traveling along historic Route 66. Nodes
and Edges could be the towns and roads along the way. Where does
information about Route 66 itself go? 

This is the canonical use case of a Path as information structure.

### Shared Content
A delivery truck driver steers a truck which physically contains packages that are owned (though not yet possed)
  by other people. 

A graph model can happily express all the relationships, smoothly answering questions like, 
  "where's my stuff?" but requires external knowledge to "get all the stuff" inside the truck without also getting
  the driver by accident. 

A document model can provide explicit containers for getting stuff in the truck, but optimizes for either 
  truck-oriented or owner-oriented queries.
A path model can do both explicitly in the data, without needing a schema or a written guidebook. 

### Decorated Graphs - D3 DG
D3.js has a lovely force-based network layout. Like many other libraries, the
  algorithm annotates the graph with position data. Wouldn't it be nice to save
  position and styling without compromising the domain data in the graph?

Paths could achieve that by following an architectural pattern called an Entity-component-system (ECS),
  a gift from the world of game development. Just wrap each Node (the entity) in a labeled Path (the system) to provide
  system-specific information (the component).


### Paths all the way down

Nodes combine with Nodes to make Edges, which can be combined to make longer Paths.
  A sequence of Paths combines everything into larger structures. Every Path combination, 
  from a single Node to a globe-spanning superstructure with all the intermediary Paths,
  are complete, valid Graphs. 

## 2. From nodes and edges, to paths
Gram structures data as property graph paths.
In practice, that means you can write a graph 
using Cypher paths like this:

```js
(a)-[e1]->(b)
(b)<-[e2]-(c)
```

The content values of a graph are attached to either nodes or edges:

```js
(a:Person {name:"Wile E. Coyote"})
(b:Company {name:"Acme, Inc."})
(a)-[e1:CUSTOMER_OF]->(b)
```

In Cypher a path is a name bound to a path expression:

```js
p = (a)-[e1]->(b)<-[e2]-(c)
```

Gram adopts the square brackets used by relationships to also delimit a path.
  This provides room for labels and records to be attached to a path:

```
[p:TROUBLESOME {accidents:12000} (a)-[e1]->(b)]
// or just...
[p:TROUBLESOME {accidents:12000} e1]
```

## 3. Write in detail, read in volume
Nodes and edges are wonderful.
