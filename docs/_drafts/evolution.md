# Data Evolution
    
Data starts small and simple. 


## 1. Just a record
    
  
```js
// a record with one field
({name:'Bartosz Milewski'})
```

### 1a. Add some detail

```js
({  name:'Bartosz Milewski',
    social: {
      about:   'https://bartoszmilewski.com',
      twitter: 'https://twitter.com/BartoszMilewski'
    },
    books: [
      {"Category Theory for Programmers":"https://www.blurb.com/b/9621951"}
    ]
}) 
```


## 2. Two records makes a pair

```js
// two records
({name:'Bartosz Milewski'}) ({title:'Category Theory for Programmers'})
```

How are these two records related? There's no direct relationship but they are part of our
collection of names. More specifically they're in a sequence of records, which means they 
are ordered: "Bartosz Milewski" then "Category Theory for Programmers". 


### 3a. Apply a label

There are other clues about how these records are related. Each has a name field, 
which _could_ mean that we've got a pair of cats. They're certainly cool cats. 

Despite what <OutboundLink href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/24012-once-you-label-me-you-negate-me">sad Danes may say</OutboundLink>, Labels 
are a way to associate things that are similar, affirming their commonality without limiting their individual qualities.

```js
// two records of names
(:Person {name:'Bartosz Milewski'}) (:Person {name:'Manuel Lima'})
```

### 2b. Add some detail

```js
(:Person {  name:'Bartosz Milewski',
            social: {
              about:   'https://bartoszmilewski.com',
              twitter: 'https://twitter.com/BartoszMilewski'
            },
            books: [
              {"Category Theory for Programmers":"https://www.blurb.com/b/9621951"}
            ]
         }
) 
(:Person {  name:'Manuel Lima',
            social: {
              about:   'https://www.mslima.com',
              twitter: 'https://twitter.com/mslima'
            },
            books: [
              {"Book of Circles":"https://twitter.com/bookofcircles"}
            ]
         }
)
```
